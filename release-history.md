        - 4901: The security service denied access. The authentication token is invalid.
        - 4903: The security service denied access. The url is expired or a token parameter is missing (expires, token, or options).
        - 4904: The security service can not be found.

~~~~
      security: {
          token: 'ewr6tzv345zw4z7ezuw4cf3c', // The security service token.
          expires: '1519819200', // The time the token expires (system time).

# [3.8.2]

## Release Notes

This version brings a new feature and several patches. We now enable adaptive buffer handling. This can be enabled by setting the new 'config.tweaks.buffewrDynamic'.
In case of short time bufferings the buffer will be stabilized. If stable playback is reached after a defined cooldown time, it will be tried to decrease the buffer till the original values. Please see documentation for further informations.
The patches bring improvements for Microsoft Edge / IE and iOS. Also network related fixes are included.

## Changelog

### Added

- enable adaptive buffer handling (iOS already has one)
    - can be set via the 'config.tweaks.bufferDynamic' object (see doc for further info)
    - disabled if no object is passed
    - detect multiple bufferings and increase buffer if necessary
    - if stable playback is detected a stepwise cooldown will be processed

~~~~
      bufferDynamic: {
          offsetThreshold: 2, //  The threshold time between two bufferings in seconds. If the measured value is lower, the buffer will be increased by offsetStep.
          offsetStep: 0.5, // The step to increase in seconds. Also the step to decrease in cooldown.
          cooldownTime: 10 // The time to check stable playback. If stable playback is detected, the buffer values will be decreased till original buffer values are reached.
      }
~~~~

# [3.3.2]

## Release Notes

This release brings many features. We introduce the new 'keepConnection' functionality (supported with h5live server 1.8.0.0 and higher).
This enables to have always a connection to the h5live server (websocket only), also if the player is not playing.
Another main feature is the new reconnect logic. It enables reconnects to the h5live server in case of recoverable network errors. If the player is playing, the playback resumes after a successful reconnect.
Related to the reconnect we added the value 'connectDelay' to the event 'onLoading', that if positive and not zero indicates that a reconnect is imminent.
Also now the network error 4503: service unavailable will be dispatched and passed through the 'onError' event.
For diagnostics of the websocket connection we now use 'performance.mark()' to log different states of the connection with timestamps.
In this release are also several fixes. There are fixes for the scaling functionality, the h5live source parsing with bintu rtmp playout object only and at least we removed flash test embed on player load.

## Changelog

### Added

- enable always keep connected for websocket to the h5live server (h5live server 1.8.0.0 and higher)
    - can be set via 'config.playback.keepConnection'
    - default: false
- enable reconnect in case of recoverable network errors (see docs), not supported on iOS with metadata disabled
    - can be set via the 'config.playback.reconnect' object
    - new player states 'RECONNECTION_IMMINENT' (13) and 'CONNECTION_ERROR' (14)
    - default:

~~~~
      reconnect: {
          minDelay: 2, //  The minimum time to reconnect in seconds. The lowest possible value is 1 sec.
          maxDelay: 10, // The maximum time to reconnect in seconds.
          delaySteps: 10, // This number of steps till the maximum delay should reached.
          maxRetries: 10 // The maximum count of reconnect tries. If set to zero no reconnect will be done.
      }
~~~~

- add property 'connectDelay' to the 'event.data' object of 'onLoading'
    - the delay in milliseconds before start connecting to the server
    - positive if a reconnect is imminent, otherwise zero
- dispatch network error 4503: service unavailable
- add performance marks with timestamps (see https://demo.nanocosmos.de/nanoplayer/docs/nanoplayer3/global.html#performancemarks),
  the middle part of the name string is the elementId of the player container (not supported on Safari 11 OSX and iOS):
    - 'nano.[playerDivId].connecting'
    - 'nano.[playerDivId].connected'
    - 'nano.[playerDivId].disconnected'
    - 'nano.[playerDivId].resuming'
    - 'nano.[playerDivId].firstFragmentReceived'
    - 'nano.[playerDivId].firstFrameRendered'
- new public event 'onWarning' with a warning message

### Fixed

## Release Notes

In this release we added the opportunity to create an audio player without video functionality.
This can be enabled by setting in the style object of the config the new property 'audioPlayer' to 'true',
for example 'config.style.audioPlayer = true'.
Controls can be enabled/disabled. The size can be customized via 'width' and 'height'. Default is 640px * 51px.

## Changelog

### Added

- enable the creation of an audio player without video functionality via 'config.style.audioPlayer = true'
    - controls can be enabled/disabled
    - the size can be customized via 'width' and 'height'
    - default is 640px * 51px

# [3.1.0]

## Release Notes

With this release comes improvements for the playback on iOS devices.
We introduce an adaptive buffer control depending on the buffer requirements of the iOS video element 
to achieve smooth playback while attempting to keep the latency as low possible. 
The adaptive buffer control is enabled by default for iOS clients. 
There is a direct correlation between the integrity of the rtmp source stream and the buffer requirements.

The second improvement is that it's now possible to configure the buffer settings also for iOS devices directly.
If the buffer tweaks will be set via config,
the adaptive buffer control will be disabled and the given value will be used as discret values.

## Changelog

### Added

- adaptive buffer control related to the buffer requirements on iOS
- enable setting buffer tweaks via config for iOS as discret values
- buffering detection for iOS

# [3.0.11]

# [3.0.2]

## Release Notes

### BREAKING CHANGE
The automatic fallback to the nanoStream Cloud h5live server has been removed. 
As a result providing the h5live.server configuration object is now mandatory, 
except if the server configuration is done through the bintu API by providing a bintu source. 
For playback from the nanoStream Cloud without the bintu API the following values have to be set. 

~~~
source.h5live.server.websocket = 'wss://h5live.nanocosmos.de:443/h5live/stream';
source.h5live.server.hls = 'https://h5live.nanocosmos.de:443/h5live/http/playlist.m3u8';
source.h5live.server.progressive = 'https://h5live.nanocosmos.de:443/h5live/http/stream.mp4';
~~~

For the On-Premise setup this server values have to be replaced with the own server urls.

### BREAKING CHANGE
The seperate configuration of the rtmp url for the fallback to flash player, 
the source.rtmp object, has been removed. Instead the rtmp url and stream name 
from the source.h5live.rtmp object will be used in this case.

Since this version the last video frame can be kept displayed after pausing the player, 
instead of displaying a black frame. The related configuration option is 
'style.keepFrame' = [true/false], which is enabled by default.

Support for playback of audio only streams has been added (at least server version 1.7 required). 
An audio symbol can be displayed during the playback of an audio only stream. 
The related configuration option is 
'style.displayAudioOnly' = [true/false], which is enabled by default.

## Changelog

### Added

- add audio only support
- add new public event 'onStreamInfo' with an streamInfo object about audio/video in the stream
- change player behaviour to always keep frame
- new config flag 'style.keepFrame' (default = true)
- new config flag 'style.displayAudioOnly' (default = true)
- add new state PAUSING to protect pausing phase
- new server event onRandomAccessPoint to enable stable seeking to keyframes in IE/Edge

### Removed

- removed external code from source code incl. config etc.
- removed rtmp source for flash, instead use the rtmp object from h5live source as fallback
- removed nanocosmos server defaults

### Fixed

- adjusted minimum buffer for ie/edge
- more stable start behaviour
